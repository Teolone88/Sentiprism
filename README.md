# Sentiprism

**Each Individual** will be part of a squad that is categorized by the function of the “squad” also specialized in something that might be a language or a technical skill which is bonded to the individual depending on that skills. Those teams are preferably under a Agile PM with co-located and distributed teams where the face to face is not always possible.
The tool will capture the mood of all the individuals anonymously and on daily basis.

- :D  
- :)  
- :|  
- :(  
- :S

Further data will be available but completely optional and not mandatory.
Also a brief free text box will be available in case the individual would like to express with some words something related to his sentiments or mood.
**This daily ceremony** will allow the 1st line management to visualize the mood and sentiment trend of all the teams and use those insightful data for better decision making. Natural language methodology will be used to extract information from the free text data.
**Every week** the tool will give the possibility to people to choose one team member and provide, if necessary, a point to one member of their team in one of the values of the organization. The individual within the team that has received most points will be entitled to have free time off as per management allowance decision. The point counter won’t be more than 4 points. Each week the counter will add one point to a max of 4 points. Each point is a feedback point to be used.
**Every week** employees will assess the squad need in order to discover their main drivers required and each member will dedicate 3 point to these traits, with free text available if required:

- Quality (Result)
- TeamWork (Relationship)
- Control (Process)
- Legacy (Value)
- Responsiveness (Responsiveness)

This will generate a useful visualization for the team main drivers depending on the period of the year. For Example in quarter end there will be more necessity of result and responsiveness for operation or more need of value and innovation for a small team of developers in a certain period of the year.
This personal identification will help the team to manage themselves during the year.
**Each month** Employee Value Propositions will be available for selection allowing the squad to identify and highlight the main need required from a list of the most common criterias from 4 categories “Opportunity”, “Organization”, “People”, “Work” with dedicated subcategories. Free text is always available during the selection if required. Those EVP are highly advisable to be discussed during a retrospective.
**Always** Employee can submit an idea under within the UML diagrams available defining processes, ideas, general improvements and the team will have the ability to comment, add stickers, evaluate and modify depending on the authority level  of the  individual. All those ideas will be available in shared repository in case you might need to revisit one of the ideas submitted previously. The manager, as the leader of the team, will have special permissions to validate and progress the status of the idea keeping boundaries intact within the system.

Sentiprism is not only a survey based tool but especially a personal space where employees can feel secure in with a lot of feeling exercise and critical information on how to improve yourself and seek help. Sentiprism will drive team members interest in seeking a more empathetic way of collaboration and sensitivity on the squad dynamics making each singular individual closer to a better leader. This will allow the employee to separate his emotional sphere from the professional one keeping an high profile in both situations.
